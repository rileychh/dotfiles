## Git Operations

- Do not automatically perform Git operations (add, commit, push, pull, etc.)
- Let the user handle all Git operations manually
- When making changes to files, remind the user to review and commit their changes when appropriate
- Do not stage files or create commits without explicit user instruction

## Commit and PR Messages

- When writing commit messages or pull request descriptions, do not include self-attribution
- Do not mention that the changes were made by Claude or AI assistance
- Write commit messages from the perspective of the developer/user
